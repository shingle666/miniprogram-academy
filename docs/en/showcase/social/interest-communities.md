```

### Interest Matching Algorithm
```javascript
// AI-powered interest matching and community discovery
class InterestMatcher {
  constructor() {
    this.userProfiles = new Map();
    this.communityProfiles = new Map();
    this.interestGraph = new InterestGraph();
  }
  
  analyzeUserInterests(userId, activities) {
    const interests = this.extractInterests(activities);
    const profile = {
      userId: userId,
      primaryInterests: interests.primary,
      secondaryInterests: interests.secondary,
      skillLevel: this.assessSkillLevel(activities),
      engagementStyle: this.analyzeEngagementStyle(activities)
    };
    
    this.userProfiles.set(userId, profile);
    return profile;
  }
  
  recommendCommunities(userId, limit = 10) {
    const userProfile = this.userProfiles.get(userId);
    const candidates = this.findCandidateCommunities(userProfile);
    
    return candidates
      .map(community => ({
        ...community,
        matchScore: this.calculateMatchScore(userProfile, community),
        reasons: this.generateMatchReasons(userProfile, community)
      }))
      .sort((a, b) => b.matchScore - a.matchScore)
      .slice(0, limit);
  }
}
```

### Community Management System
```javascript
// Comprehensive community management and moderation
class CommunityManager {
  createCommunity(creatorId, communityData) {
    const community = {
      id: generateCommunityId(),
      name: communityData.name,
      description: communityData.description,
      category: communityData.category,
      tags: communityData.tags,
      creator: creatorId,
      moderators: [creatorId],
      members: [creatorId],
      settings: {
        privacy: communityData.privacy || 'public',
        joinApproval: communityData.requireApproval || false,
        contentModeration: 'automatic',
        allowedContentTypes: ['text', 'image', 'link']
      },
      stats: {
        memberCount: 1,
        postCount: 0,
        activityScore: 0
      },
      createdAt: Date.now()
    };
    
    this.communityProfiles.set(community.id, community);
    this.initializeCommunityFeatures(community.id);
    return community;
  }
  
  manageMembership(communityId, action, userId, moderatorId) {
    const community = this.getCommunity(communityId);
    
    if (!this.hasModeratorPermission(moderatorId, communityId)) {
      throw new Error('Insufficient permissions');
    }
    
    switch(action) {
      case 'approve':
        community.members.push(userId);
        this.notifyMembershipApproval(userId, communityId);
        break;
      case 'remove':
        community.members = community.members.filter(id => id !== userId);
        this.notifyMembershipRemoval(userId, communityId);
        break;
      case 'promote':
        community.moderators.push(userId);
        this.notifyModeratorPromotion(userId, communityId);
        break;
    }
    
    this.updateCommunityStats(communityId);
  }
}
```

### Reputation & Gamification System
```javascript
// Community reputation and engagement system
class ReputationSystem {
  constructor() {
    this.userReputations = new Map();
    this.badgeSystem = new BadgeSystem();
    this.achievementTracker = new AchievementTracker();
  }
  
  recordActivity(userId, communityId, activity) {
    const points = this.calculatePoints(activity);
    const reputation = this.getUserReputation(userId, communityId);
    
    reputation.totalPoints += points;
    reputation.activities.push({
      type: activity.type,
      points: points,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
    
    this.updateUserLevel(userId, communityId);
    this.checkBadgeEligibility(userId, communityId);
    this.updateLeaderboards(communityId);
  }
  
  calculatePoints(activity) {
    const pointValues = {
      'post_created': 10,
      'comment_added': 5,
      'answer_accepted': 25,
      'helpful_vote': 2,
      'resource_shared': 15,
      'event_organized': 50
    };
    
    return pointValues[activity.type] || 1;
  }
  
  getUserLevel(userId, communityId) {
    const reputation = this.getUserReputation(userId, communityId);
    const levels = [
      { name: 'Newcomer', minPoints: 0 },
      { name: 'Contributor', minPoints: 100 },
      { name: 'Regular', minPoints: 500 },
      { name: 'Expert', minPoints: 1500 },
      { name: 'Master', minPoints: 5000 }
    ];
